Over the past few years our web design team has created five different websites for the California Cut Flower Commission. One of the properties owned by this commission is the nationwide American Grown Flowers marketing program. This effort raises awareness and educates consumers on the many benefits of buying American grown flowers. Using our development process, our team worked together with the organization to optimize the viewing experience into a platform for communications and all the information one would need to know about the flower growing industry here in California and the rest of the country. Some of these sites are built for domestic consumers but we have also built sites for audiences and markets in Asia. Some of the other online solutions we have provided include creating email news blasts, videos and both static and animated social media graphics.
