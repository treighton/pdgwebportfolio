Our work with the California Rice Commission dates back to the early 90â€™s. During that time we have designed all of their websites and all other related online communications. The site shown here is the main, public-facing website for the commission. This site highlights all elements of the California rice industry including topics related to the environment, public policy, farming, wildlife, recipes, and other related information about rice in California. This site leverages the use of many great photos and videos produced throughout the year.
