This online version of Synthesis magazine follows the same work flow and requirements when our team creates the online version of the UC Davis Health magazine. This project starts with our graphic design team laying out the printed version of this magazine. After the final magazine is approved to print, we begin translating this entire publication into a lively website that is optimized for online consumption and SEO purposes. This conversion is a delicate design and coding process that requires us to adjust the existing website template parameters to produce a custom online version of this publication that also looks great on every devices.
