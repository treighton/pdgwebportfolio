The California Rice Commission and Northern California Water Association worked together to create a rich tapestry of content highlighting compelling stories from the Sacramento Valley. After the collection was started, they then reached out to Page Design Group to build a website to organize and house all of this content. Another goal was to make the content easy to find and search using a variety of different search techniques. This website design takes full advantage of all the great stories, photos and videos to show off all the great things about living in the Sacramento Valley.
