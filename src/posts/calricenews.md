Our work with the California Rice Commission dates back to the early 90â€™s. During that time we have designed all of their websites and all other related online communications. The site shown here is purpose-built for all rice industry insiders. This audience would include rice farmers and other related policy makers. The secret behind this industry communication website is the integration with a collection of different blogging and social media tools that instantly alert constituents with valuable updates to a collection of topics within the industry.
