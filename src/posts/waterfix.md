California WaterFix is a science-driven upgrade to our aging water system. It will provide clean, reliable water while protecting our environment and addresses five main areas of concern including water security, environmental protection, reduced risk from environmental changes, increased water use efficiency, and technological upgrades to the California water system. Since 2016, Page Design Group has been building and  managing the main project website. As we have worked with the WaterFix team, the site has transformed and grown to adapt to the changing needs of one of the largest infrastructure projects in California.
