When FAST came to us with a need for a branding refresh, we developed the new logo and all other related print materials. After we finished with that effort, our team went to work building an updated website. Our initial review of the site traffic uncovered that over 80% of the traffic coming to the website was from a mobile device. So it was pertinent that we design the site with a “mobile first” approach. The other requirement was that the site needed to have an administration panel that allowed FAST staff members to quickly update the content and schedules on the website.
