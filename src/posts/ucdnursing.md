The web design team at Page Design Group helped to refine and construct an updated version of this popular website, using all the new conventions in the updated templates, provided by the UC Davis web communications team. This required some analysis on how the variety of users might want to use the site. Our team took into consideration the variety of audiences and optimized the site to work best for all of these parties. Another element of this project includes the translation of the annual printed version of the school magazine, into an optimized online version that works similar to the online version of the UC Davis Health magazine that we also produce.
