As part of our responsibilities in creating the printed version of the UC Davis Health magazine, we also translate the entire publication into a lively website. This conversion is a delicate design process that requires us to work inside the existing website parameters to adjust the layouts and optimize them for online consumption. These layout considerations must also be flexible enough to work on all devices.
